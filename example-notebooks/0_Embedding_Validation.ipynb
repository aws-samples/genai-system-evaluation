    "# Overview\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to demonstrate how to evaluate an embedding model as well as how to evaluate your chunking strategy. Typically, you get better performance boosts out of picking a solid chunking strategy over swapping out an embedding model. In this notebook, we will demonstrate both. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Background\n",
    "Before evaluating an embedding model, it’s important to understand “What” we’re using an embedding model for. The most popular public benchmark is the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark or MTEB. HuggingFace maintains a leaderboard to compare general purpose embedding models against each other to see how they stack up against a wide range of tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a decent starting place, but you have to ask yourself, how well does this dataset compliment the task I really care about. If I’m creating a RAG Solution for Lawyers, I’m much more interested in how well the embedding model works for comparing legal text vs. how well it works for medical text. This is why it’s important to build out your own evaluation. A model that might not rank high on a general-purpose benchmark, could rank very high on your specific use case. If none of them work very well, then you can make a case for fine tuning an existing model on your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What Metrics Should You Care About?**\n",
    "To answer this question, we need to understand what we’re using the embedding model for. For an information retrieval use case, we care about different metrics than we would for a clustering use case. Because retrieval tends to be the most important use case in RAG, lets focus on retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classic methods apply here to embeddings model like recall@k, precision@k, etc..\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to Evaluate**\n",
    "To perform this evaluation, you need to set up a retrieval task. Generate vector representations of items (documents or chunks) in a shared semantic space and perform a K-nearest-neighbor search on them using a similarity measure (e.g. cosine-similarity, dot-product). This gives you the top-k retrieved item for each query.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need a set of relevance judgments that indicate which documents are relevant to each query. These are typically created by human annotators or derived from click data in product systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each query, count the number of relevant items in the top-k retrieved results. Calculate the precision using (number of relevant documents / k). Average the precision values across all queries. \n",
    "Apply these same techniques to other metrics like recall, NDCG, or MAP for a more comprehensive evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to create relevance judgements? \n",
    "This is a pretty manual process. For this example, I pasted large chunks of the Opensearch documentation into Claude and asked Claude to come up with a couple example questions about the context. I find it easier to build a validation set where the answer corresponds to 1 to 3 pages. You'll likely tweak your chunking strategy over time, but the relative file paths will stay constant so you don't have to redo your validation dataset every time you make a change to the chunks. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# What Will We Do? \n",
    "* We will start with a basic sentence splitting chunking strategy, create embeddings for them, and store them in an in memory vector store (chromaDB).\n",
    "* We will then use our evaluation dataset (which I already created) to run multiple experiments using different embedding models and chunking strategies to see which gives us the best results based on our metrics. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Lets get started!**"

    "#### Word of Caution: On Using GenAI Frameworks\n",
    "For chunking, we'll use LlamaIndex. There are many tools/frameworks for ingesting documents and implementing chunking strategies. I personally like LlamaIndex because it offers a lot of advanced chunking options. It creates \"nodes\" that can be converted into different formats for ingestion.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using these GenAI frameworks, it's best to not rely too heavily on them. In the example below, we'll use LlamaIndex but we'll wrap the chunking logic in a class and normalize the output to a class that we create named RAGChunk. This way, we aren't too reliant on the framework. None of these frameworks are particularly \"stable\" and newer versions are often times not backwards compatible. It's best to contain the package to minimize the impact on the rest of your system if/when you need to have more control."

    "The results aren't.. terrible. But they could also be a lot better. We plan to add a ReRank step in the next notebook, so while rank based metrics are important at this stage, we care more about whether the top k results have relevant data in them. This makes recall@5 arguably the most important metric to evaluate on in this step.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, all the metrics are important to understand how the base IR task is performing. We want to limit the amount of context we pass back to the model to save on input token cost so knowing precesion@1 and precision@5 give us an idea of how well the embeddings are working on their own at ranking the results. We can then take these runs and compare it against a re-ranked list to see (if) re-rank improves this task.\n",
